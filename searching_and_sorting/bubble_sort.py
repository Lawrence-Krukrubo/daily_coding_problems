"""
Bubble sort as the name implies is a sorting Algorithm that leads the biggest
Element to float like a bubble to the end of the array.

1. Bubble sort is an in-place sorting Algorithm. This means it solves the problem,
right within the array, without needing any external help or temporary representation

2. Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2).
Since it goes through the array n times and for each n element 2.

3. But in terms of space, Bubble sort is very efficient with a space complexity of O(1) or constant.
Meaning we don't need any extra space or extra arrays to solve a bubble sort problem.
